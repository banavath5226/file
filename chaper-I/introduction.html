    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <h2>1.1Problem Statement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li ><b>Every company wants to understand their customer.</b></li>
        <li><b>In the past, surveys were required to get an idea of how customers 
            felt about products, but today we get in the form of reviews. </b></li>
        <li><b>Reading each & every review will be a heavy task to everyone, as 
            there are lakhs of reviews.</b> </li>
        <li><b>Understanding the people’s attitude, thought, or judgment 
            prompted by feeling is the major topic of text mining research due to 
            its wide range of applications. </b></li>
        <li><b>It’s challenging to get the sentiment in the given data(reviews).</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.2 Proposed System</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>This system is used to get the sentiment in the given reviews.</b></li>
        <li><b>This system takes the reviews extracted by the user.</b></li>
        <li><b>Here we used RStudio for Visualization.</b>
            <h3>Sentimental analysis occurs in 3 steps</h3>
            <ol><b>
                <li>Evaluative terms expressing opinions must be extracted 
                    from the review. </li>
                <li>The polarity, of the opinions must be determined.</li>
                <li>Finally, the review is classified with respect to sentiment 
                    classes, such as Positive and Negative, based on the 
                    polarity of the opinions it contains</li>
                </li>
            </ol></b>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.3 Scope Of The Mini Project</h2>
    <b>
    <ul>
        <li>Sentiment analysis has been an important tool for brands looking 
            to learn more about how their customers are thinking and feeling.</li>
        <li>It is a relatively simplistic form of analytics that helps brands find key 
            areas of weakness (negative sentiments) and strengths (positive 
            sentiments). </li>
        <li>Moving forward, sentiment analysis is finding a place in other 
            organizations.</li>
        <li>During Brexit and the 2016 US election, these data tools were used 
            to measure emotions and attempt to predict the outcome of these 
            events. </li>
        <li>This has led to non-brand organizations turning to sentiment analysis 
            for their own needs.</li>
        <li>Additionally, the insights gained from these tools are becoming 
            much deeper, as a result of emerging social media platforms and 
            features</li>
    </ul>
