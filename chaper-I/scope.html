<h2>1.3 Scope Of The Mini Project</h2>
<b>
<ul>
    <li>Sentiment analysis has been an important tool for brands looking 
        to learn more about how their customers are thinking and feeling.</li>
    <li>It is a relatively simplistic form of analytics that helps brands find key 
        areas of weakness (negative sentiments) and strengths (positive 
        sentiments). </li>
    <li>Moving forward, sentiment analysis is finding a place in other 
        organizations.</li>
    <li>During Brexit and the 2016 US election, these data tools were used 
        to measure emotions and attempt to predict the outcome of these 
        events. </li>
    <li>This has led to non-brand organizations turning to sentiment analysis 
        for their own needs.</li>
    <li>Additionally, the insights gained from these tools are becoming 
        much deeper, as a result of emerging social media platforms and 
        features</li>
</ul>
